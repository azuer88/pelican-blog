It turns and turns.  It doesn't care if it brings you up or down.  It turns and turns.  It doesn't care if it uplifts or crushes you.   Still it turns and turns.  Won't matter what you want, what you desperately need.  It turns and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't make it stop.  You can't get off.  You can't do anything but ride it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is it funny?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny how most everyone is asleep.  Funny how they are unable to see beyond the dream they are living in.  Funny how they pity.  Funny how they spend their life in their dream.  Oh, how happily do they march to the tune of their own lullaby.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is ignorance bliss?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I wish I was ignorant, but only for that single eye blink.  I can never be a sheep.  I can not live in a box, no matter how pretty it is painted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you awake? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is funny and tragic, isn't it?  How the world turns.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rants"></category></entry></feed>
