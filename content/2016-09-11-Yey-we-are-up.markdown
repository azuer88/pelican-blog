Summary: Trying out Github Pages 


I am trying out Github Pages.  

I will most likely use this for my blog and update as often as I can.

As I am still learning how to use Jekyll, I'll just use the defaults for now.  I'll play with the bells and whistles as I move along.

I like the powerful support for code snippets.  So, I'll probably post a lot of my snippets here; and probably config settings that I am liable to forget.
